# üåä LiquidSpikeFormer: Neuromorphic Hybrid SNN-Transformer Architecture

## üö© Overview

**LiquidSpikeFormer** is an advanced neuromorphic deep learning architecture specifically designed to tackle the complexities and challenges associated with processing sparse, asynchronous, and event-driven data from Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS).

Leveraging the synergy of **Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)**, **Liquid Neural Networks (LNNs)**, and state-of-the-art **Transformer** models, this project explores efficient and biologically plausible ways to significantly enhance accuracy, latency, and generalization performance in event-based recognition tasks.
